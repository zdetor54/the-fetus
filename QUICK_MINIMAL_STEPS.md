# 🚀 Quick Steps to Get Minimal Window

## What You Want:
**No title bar - just the 3 window control icons (_, □, ✕) and your app content**

## What I Changed:
✅ Updated `manifest.json` with `window-controls-overlay` mode
✅ Updated `style.css` with special PWA CSS
✅ Uncommented theme colors for better appearance

## 🎯 What You'll See:

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 🖥️ [Big Title Bar]  _ □ ✕│ ← Thick bar
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Your app content            │
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Your navbar        _ □ ✕   │ ← Just icons!
│ App content starts higher   │
```

## ⚠️ Important:
- **MUST uninstall first** - updates don't apply to existing installations
- **Only works in Chrome/Edge** - other browsers get standard window
- **Navbar is draggable** - click and drag empty space to move window
