# 🎯 Removing Extension Icons from PWA Window

## The Problem:
You see browser extension icons (🔑 key icon, extension icons) in the top-right of your installed PWA window, next to the window controls.

## ⚠️ Important:
**These icons CANNOT be removed through your app's code.** They are controlled by Chrome/Edge browser settings.

---

## ✅ Solutions:

### **Solution 1: Hide Extensions in App Windows (Recommended)**

Chrome/Edge allow extensions to run in installed PWA apps. You can control this:

#### **Method A - Per Extension:**
1. **Right-click the extension icon** (the key 🔑 or extension icon)
2. Select **"This can read and change site data"**
3. Choose **"On click"** or **"On specific sites"**
4. The icon will be hidden from the app window

#### **Method B - Remove Extension from Toolbar:**
1. **Right-click the extension icon**
2. Select **"Remove from Chrome"** or **"Unpin"**
3. Or choose **"Manage extension"** → Turn off "Show in toolbar"

#### **Method C - Disable Extension Completely:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`
2. Find the extension (password manager, etc.)
3. Toggle it **OFF**
4. Or click **"Remove"** to uninstall

---

### **Solution 2: Hide ALL Extension Icons**

**In Chrome:**
1. Click the **puzzle piece icon** (🧩) next to extensions
2. Click the **pin icon** next to each extension to unpin it
3. Or go to: `chrome://extensions`
4. Turn off "Show in toolbar" for each extension

**In Edge:**
1. Click **extensions icon** (puzzle piece)
2. Click **"Manage extensions"**
3. Turn off "Show in toolbar" for unwanted extensions

---

### **Solution 3: Use Chrome/Edge Without Extensions**

Create a separate browser profile just for your app:

1. **Create New Profile:**
   - Chrome: Settings → "Add person"
   - Edge: Settings → "Profiles" → "Add profile"

2. **Install App in New Profile:**
   - Switch to the new profile
   - Don't install any extensions
   - Install your PWA app
   - Result: Clean window with no extension icons!

3. **Use This Profile for Your App Only**

---

### **Solution 4: Package as Electron App (Advanced)**

For a truly clean experience without ANY browser UI:

1. Package your Flask app with Electron
2. Electron gives you complete control over the window
3. No browser extensions will appear
4. More work, but truly native experience

**Later, I can help you do this if you want.**

## 🎯 **Quick Fix (Recommended):**

### For Password Manager (Key Icon 🔑):

The key icon is likely **1Password**, **LastPass**, or **Bitwarden**.

**Quick steps:**
1. Right-click the **key icon** 🔑
2. Select **"Manage extension"**
3. Scroll to **"Site access"** or **"This can read and change site data"**
4. Change to **"On click"** or **"When you click the extension"**
5. Close and reopen your app

**Or:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Find your password manager
3. Click **"Details"**
4. Change **"Site access"** to **"On click"**

---

## 🔍 **Identifying Your Extensions:**

To see which extensions are showing:

1. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`
2. Look at enabled extensions
3. Common culprits:
   - 🔑 **Password managers** (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
   - 🧩 **Browser extensions** (ad blockers, VPNs, etc.)
   - 🎨 **Theme extensions**

---

## 📝 **Why This Happens:**

When you install a PWA:
- Chrome/Edge creates a "app window"
- But it's still running in the browser
- Extensions that have "access to all sites" show their icons
- They think they should be available in your app

---

## ✅ **Step-by-Step to Clean Window:**

### **1. Find Extension Names:**
```
chrome://extensions (in Chrome)
edge://extensions (in Edge)
```

### **2. For Each Extension:**
- Click **"Details"**
- Change **"Site access"** to **"On click"**
- Or toggle **"Show in toolbar"** OFF

### **3. Restart Your App:**
- Close the installed app
- Reopen from Start Menu
- Icons should be gone!

---

## 🎨 **Best Practice:**

### **Create Dedicated Browser Profile:**

1. **New Profile = Clean Start**
   - No extensions installed
   - Clean PWA windows
   - No clutter

2. **How to Create:**
   ```
   Chrome: Settings → "You and Google" → "Add"
   Edge: Settings → "Profiles" → "Add profile"
   ```

3. **Name it:** "Work Apps" or "Medical Apps"

4. **Install your PWA in this profile**

5. **Result:** Completely clean window! 🎉

---

## 🆘 **Can't Remove Specific Icon?**

If an icon won't go away:

1. **Screenshot the icon** (you did this! ✅)
2. **Go to:** `chrome://extensions`
3. **Disable extensions one by one** until the icon disappears
4. **That's the culprit!**
5. **Change its settings** or remove it

---

## 🎯 **Visual Result:**

**Before (With Extension Icons):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your App    🔑 🧩 👤  _ □ ✕        │ ← Extensions!
```

**After (Clean):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your App              👤  _ □ ✕     │ ← Clean!
```

Or even better with new profile:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your App                  _ □ ✕     │ ← Minimal!
```
