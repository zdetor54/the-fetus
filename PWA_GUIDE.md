# PWA (Progressive Web App) Implementation Guide

## 🎉 What's New?

Your Flask app is now a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**! This means users can:

✅ **Install it like a native app** on any device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
✅ **Run it without browser UI** (no address bar, tabs, or browser chrome)
✅ **Access it from home screen/desktop** with a custom icon
✅ **Work offline** (basic caching implemented)
✅ **Still use it as a regular website** - nothing breaks!

---

## 📱 User Experience

### Mobile/Tablet (iOS & Android)
1. User visits your website in Safari/Chrome
2. Browser shows: **"Add Fetus to Home Screen"**
3. User taps "Add"
4. App icon appears on home screen
5. Tapping icon opens full-screen app (no browser UI)

### Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux)
1. User visits your website in Chrome/Edge
2. Browser shows **install icon (⊕)** in address bar OR
3. **"Install App"** button appears at bottom-right
4. User clicks to install
5. App opens in standalone window
6. App appears in Start Menu/Applications

### Regular Browser Access
- Users can still access normally at your URL
- No installation required
- Everything works as before

## 🚀 Testing Locally

### 1. Start Your Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

### 2. Open in Chrome/Edge
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Install the App

**Option A - Address Bar:**
- Look for install icon (⊕) in the address bar
- Click it and select "Install"

**Option B - Install Button:**
- Look for "Install App" button at bottom-right of page
- Click to install

**Option C - Menu:**
- Chrome: Menu → "Install Fetus..."
- Edge: Menu → Apps → "Install this site as an app"

### 4. Verify Installation
- App opens in standalone window (no browser UI)
- Check Start Menu/Applications for "Fetus" app
- Try closing and reopening from Start Menu

---

## 🌐 Deploying to Production

### Requirements for PWA:
1. ✅ **HTTPS Required** - PWAs only work on HTTPS (or localhost)
2. ✅ **All files uploaded** - Ensure manifest.json, sw.js, and icons are deployed
3. ✅ **Correct MIME types** - Routes in __init__.py handle this

### Deployment Checklist:

#### For PythonAnywhere:
```bash
# 1. Upload all files via Git or file manager
git add .
git commit -m "Added PWA support"
git push origin main

# 2. Pull on PythonAnywhere
cd ~/the-fetus
git pull origin main

# 3. Reload web app from PythonAnywhere dashboard

# 4. Test at your domain (must be HTTPS)
https://yourdomain.pythonanywhere.com
```

#### For Azure App Service:
```bash
# Already configured! Just push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added PWA support"
git push azure main

# Or use your existing deployment method
```

### 5. Verify PWA Works:
1. Visit your HTTPS site on mobile
2. Browser should prompt to "Add to Home Screen"
3. On desktop, install icon should appear
4. Test installation and standalone mode

---

## 📱 Installing on Different Platforms

## 🎨 Customizing Icons

The current icons are simple placeholders. To create professional icons:

### Option 1: Use the SVG Files
The SVG files in `fetusapp/static/icons/` have your fetus logo. Convert them:
1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Upload `icon-192x192.svg` → set output size to 192x192
3. Upload `icon-512x512.svg` → set output size to 512x512
4. Download and replace the PNG files

### Option 2: Design Custom Icons
Use any graphics tool (Photoshop, Figma, Canva):
- Create 192x192px PNG (for standard displays)
- Create 512x512px PNG (for high-res displays)
- Use pink background `#EF539E` with white logo
- Save as `icon-192x192.png` and `icon-512x512.png`
- Place in `fetusapp/static/icons/`

### Option 3: Regenerate with Better Script
Install dependencies and use the SVG converter:
```bash
pip install pillow cairosvg
python generate_icons.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Customizing App Behavior

Edit `fetusapp/static/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Your App Name",           // Full name in install prompt
  "short_name": "Short Name",        // Name under icon (12 chars max)
  "theme_color": "#EF539E",          // Color of address bar/status bar
  "background_color": "#212529",     // Splash screen background
  "display": "standalone"            // Options: standalone, fullscreen, minimal-ui
}
```

### Display Modes:
- **standalone** - Looks like native app (recommended)
- **fullscreen** - No system UI at all
- **minimal-ui** - Minimal browser controls
- **browser** - Regular browser tab

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Install" button doesn't appear
- ✅ Ensure you're using Chrome or Edge
- ✅ Check DevTools Console for errors
- ✅ On production, must use HTTPS
- ✅ Clear browser cache and reload

### PWA doesn't work on iOS
- ✅ Must use Safari (not Chrome) on iOS
- ✅ Use "Add to Home Screen" in Share menu
- ✅ iOS doesn't support install prompts

### Service Worker not registering
- ✅ Check Console for errors
- ✅ Verify `sw.js` is accessible at `/static/sw.js`
- ✅ Must be HTTPS in production

### Icons not showing
- ✅ Verify PNG files exist in `fetusapp/static/icons/`
- ✅ Check file sizes (192x192 and 512x512)
- ✅ Clear browser cache

### App doesn't work offline
- Service Worker caches only static assets
- Dynamic patient data requires server connection
- This is intentional for data security

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Service Worker only caches static files (CSS, JS, icons)
- Patient data is NEVER cached offline
- All data requests still require authentication
- HTTPS is required in production (enforced by browsers)
