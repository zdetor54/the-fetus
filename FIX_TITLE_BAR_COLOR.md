## 🎯 Other Theme Color Options:

If you want different colors, edit `manifest.json` and `base.html`:

### **Option 1: Completely Black**
```json
"theme_color": "#000000"
```

### **Option 2: Match Navbar (Dark Gray)**
```json
"theme_color": "#212529"  ← Current (matches bg-dark)
```

### **Option 3: Transparent/Minimal**
Unfortunately, `transparent` doesn't work, but dark colors blend in well.

### **Option 4: Your Brand Color (Pink)**
```json
"theme_color": "#EF539E"  ← Original (what you had)
```

## 📝 Note About Window Controls Overlay:

Even with `window-controls-overlay` mode, Chrome/Edge may still show a thin title bar depending on:
- Your Windows theme (light/dark mode)
- Browser version
- Whether the feature is fully enabled

The **dark theme color** makes it blend with your app much better!

## ⚡ Quick Test:

Can't wait to uninstall? Try this:

1. Go to `http://localhost:8080` in browser (as website)
2. Check the browser tab color - should be dark now
3. This confirms the theme color changed

But to see it in the installed app, you MUST reinstall!

## 🆘 Still Seeing Pink Title Bar?

1. ✅ **Did you uninstall?** This is the most common issue!
2. ✅ **Did you clear cache?** Browser caches manifest
3. ✅ **Did you close ALL browser windows?** Cache persists
4. ✅ **Did you reinstall fresh?** Not just reopen existing app

---

**The title bar will now be dark and blend with your app! 🎉**

Much less noticeable than the bright pink! 🌙
